# 🌍 Impact of Climate Change on Global Food Security

This project analyzes how climate change indicators affect food security across 113 countries using the Global Food Security Index dataset. Using **R**, we applied descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, regression models, and ANOVA to uncover the relationships between climate variables and food security components like affordability, availability, quality, and sustainability.

## 📊 Summary

- Conducted data cleaning, transformation, and standardization  
- Performed exploratory data analysis using **histograms, box plots, scatter plots, heatmaps,** and **geographical mapping**
- Applied **Pearson correlation**, **linear and multiple regression**, and **ANOVA** to examine statistical significance
- Found strong positive correlations between affordability and food security (r = 0.79), and moderate correlations for sustainability (r = 0.61)
- Results emphasize the need for integrated, climate-resilient food security policies
